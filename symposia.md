<p>The history of the Utah Construction Company and its successors is an American success story that stretches from its simple beginnings laying rail lines across the West to its role in creating some of the most monumental structures of the 20th century. From its founding in Ogden, Utah, in 1900 until 1976 when Utah International and General Electric negotiated the largest corporate merger in the United States to that time, Utah Construction transformed lives worldwide through the vision of its founders.</p>

<p>In October 1999, the Utah Construction/Utah International Collection was donated to Weber State University’s Stewart Library by Edmund Wattis Littlefield, former company president and chairman of the board, and by Broken Hill Proprietary, Ltd. The company archives contained more than 300 boxes of minutes, financial records, correspondence, scrapbooks, and project reports and more than half a million photographs. A gift from the William H. &amp; Mattie Wattis Harris Foundation assisted in processing and preserving this extensive collection and in underwriting its public unveiling in 2001.</p>

<p>The collection was unveiled to the public, WSU community, and founders’ family members in fall 2001. The Stewart Library published Preserving the Memories, with short biographical sketches of the company’s founders and a collection of historic photographs that gave an overview of Utah Construction’s accomplishments. The university produced a video that included interviews from representatives of each founder’s family. The library also presented an exhibit of photographs from the company’s projects worldwide. Robert Gottlieb, Henry R. Luce Professor of Urban and Environmental Policy at Occidental College, gave a public presentation, “Why Place Matters: Lessons for a Changing West.”</p></li>

<li><h4><a href="symposia_pages/2002.html">Geiger Utah Construction/Utah International Symposium 2002</a></h4>

<p>The second annual symposium featured Utah International: A Biography of a Business by Gene A. Sessions and Sterling D. Sessions, a commemorative edition of the company’s history published by Weber State and the Stewart Library. The symposium also featured a conversation with the authors; a lecture by Dr. Thomas G. Alexander, the Lemuel H. Redd, Jr. Professor of American Western History at Brigham Young University; and a photographic exhibit on “Mining in the West” which included artifacts, photographs, and memorabilia.</p></li>

<li><h4><a href="symposia_pages/2003.html">Hoover damn Utah Construction/Utah International Symposium 2003</a></h4>

<p>“Water and Power in the American West” was the theme for the third annual symposium, which had as its centerpiece a photographicexhibit and a publication on the construction of the Hoover Dam. Inside the Hoover Dam Scrapbooks was based on the photographic scrapbooks presented to Six Companies officials following the dedication of the Hoover Dam. A lecture and panel discussion featuredhistory scholars and an exchange of ideas on the Bureau of Reclamation and water rights in dam construction projects. Additional images and charts from the McNamara family rounded out the exhibit.</p></li>

<li><h4><a href="symposia_pages/2004.html">Utah Construction/Utah International Symposium 2004</a></h4>

<p>Making Tracks: Railroading 1900-1930 focused on the company’s role in the dramatic expansion of the West through the construction of the railway system. It included a panel discussion and a lecture on photography along the Western railroads. A photographic exhibit and a publication featured the Feather River line; the Tepic to La Quemada; and the grand opening of the line between Klamath Falls, Oregon, and Alturas, California.</p></li>

<li><h4><a href="symposia_pages/2005.html">Utah Construction/Utah International Symposium 2005</a></h4>

<p>Building America’s Defense: 1939-1975” was the theme of the 2005 symposium. A photographic exhibit and a publication featured a variety of military projects ranging from the building of the Alaska Highway to the construction of NORAD. Speakers included historians Douglas Brinkley and Robert Berlin, WSU professors of History Bill Allison, Susan Matt, Gene Sessions, and former company geologist Charles D. Snow.</p></li>

<li><h4><a href="symposia_pages/2006.html">Utah Construction/Utah International Symposium 2006</a></h4>

<p>The sixth annual symposium will explore the combined leadership of Marriner S. Eccles and Edmund W. Littlefield, who each served as company president and chair of the board of directors. Although the two men contrasted in personality and management style, their talents and interaction developed Utah International as a successful mining multi-national and poised it for the 1976 merger with General Electric.</p></li>

<li><h4><a href="symposia_pages/2007.html">Founder_David Eccles  Utah Construction/Utah International Symposium 2007</a></h4>

<p>The 2007 Symposium explores the emergence of the Utah Construction Company and the lives and careers of its entrepreneurial founders - Thomas D. Dee, David Eccles, Edmund O., William H. and Warren L. Wattis.
The university has only begun to develop the potential of the collection. The company’s history of achievement represents a wealth of experience in the areas of project management, strategic planning, decision-making and corporate leadership.</p></li>

<h4>White Glove Event</h4>

</header>

<p>On Saturday, October 20, 2012, guests gathered at WSU’s Stewart Library Special Collections for a special “white glove” event. University President, Ann Millner, began the event by welcoming everyone and expressing her appreciation for the support given to process the Utah Construction Company Collection. After further remarks by Marta Wojcicki, BHP Billiton Records Governance Specialist, and Dan McNamara, great-grandson of W.H. Wattis, and former UCC employee, guests were able to view two new exhibits and tour the storage facility for the new additions.</p>
